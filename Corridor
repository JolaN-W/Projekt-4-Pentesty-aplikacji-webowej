TASK: What is the flag?

I started nmap to scan open ports and running services, and I discovered that itâ€™s running an HTTP service on port 80:

$ nmap -sV -sC -v 10.10.22.208

After opening the site there's a standard web page with an image:

I checked the page source and found something like hashes:

 I used hash-identifer to check type of hash:

I used crackstation to crack the hashes:

I've used $ echo -n "14" | md5sum to transform "14" to md5 hash, but it didn't work:

$ echo -n "0" | md5sum

and I've got a flag:

flag{2477ef02448ad9156661ac40a6b8862e}
